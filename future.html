      <h4>What are my goals for this program and beyond?</h4>
      <p>I want to begin by building a career in the industry with the skills<br>
        and knowledge I have gained from Galvanize. I then want to keep learning.<br>
        I have a desire to build an online platform for screenwriters so they have<br>
        a place to work even if they live in different time zones. One of my other<br>
        passions other than filmmaking is video games. My ultimate goal is to become<br>
        a video game developer. I would love to write them. I have found that those<br>
        who write the games are most commonly the same people who code them. I want<br>
        to get to this point so that I can write and develop my own video game.</p>
