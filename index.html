        <h4>What else should you know about me?</h4>
        <p>
          I have a background in aerospace engineering. I moved out to Washington State in 2012.<br>
          I spent two years at Boeing as a manufacturing engineer. After my time there I went on<br>
          to pursue a year long film mentorship where I worked with mentors on a feature length<br>
          film as well as my own feature length script.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a passion for storytelling. Whether that is through creating a children's book <br>
          or a feature length script, storytelling allows me to be as creative as possible. I   <br>
          hope to be able to take this passion and apply it to programming.
